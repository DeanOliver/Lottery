Task 1
3 matches: 1/17296       (48 nCr 3)
4 matches: 1/194580      (48 nCr 4)
5 matches: 1/1712304     (48 nCr 5)
6 matches: 1/12271512    (48 nCr 6)

Task 2
I don't know the mathmatics needed to calculate winnings percentages, based on the probability of certain odds and prize pool size. I tried looking online and just came across many papers on the subject, so I have assumed I'm over thinkng it.

These are the rough ones I used after testing them for a while:
3 matches: 0.000001% payout
4 matches: 0.00002% payout
5 matches: 0.0008% payout
6 matches: 0.20% payout

Probably best I stick to programming and don’t become a bookie right away.

Task 3
